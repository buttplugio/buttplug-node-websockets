# Buttplug Node Websockets

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/buttplug-node-websockets.svg)](https://npmjs.com/package/buttplug-node-websockets) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/qdot/buttplug-node-websockets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/metafetish/buttplug-node-websockets) [![Patreon donate button](https://img.shields.io/badge/patreon-donate-yellow.svg)](https://www.patreon.com/qdot)

buttplug-node-websockets provides convenience client/server classes
built on top of [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) and
[buttplug-js](https://github.com/metafetish/buttplug-js). It allows
developers to quickly integrate buttplug clients and servers into
native node applications.

Every donation helps us afford more hardware to reverse, document, and
write code for!

## Installation

To install buttplug-js in your node project via npm, a simple add call
should do it.

```
npm add buttplug-node-websockets
```

buttplug-node-websockets is considered a plugin for buttplug-js, and
has buttplug as a peer dependency. You will need to add buttplug-js >=
0.4.0 to the project that is using buttplug-node-websockets in order
for this to work correctly.

## API Documentation

buttplug-node-websocket API Documentation is available at
[https://metafetish.github.io/buttplug-node-websockets](https://metafetish.github.io/buttplug-node-websockets).

The documentation is rebuilt on every commit/merge to master.

## Usage Example

### Server

The client class provided with this library derives from the
ButtplugServer class, and can be used as a standalone server.

```javascript
let Buttplug = require('buttplug');
let ButtplugNodeWebsockets = require('buttplug-node-websockets');

let server = new ButtplugNodeWebsocket.ButtplugNodeWebsocketServer();

// Insecure hosting, on localhost:12345
server.StartInsecureServer()

// Secure hosting, on 192.168.1.2:6969
// Cert and Private should be paths to cert/private files
server.StartSecureServer("./cert.pem", "./private.pem", 6969, "192.168.1.2");

// ...
```

If you need to create a local secure server with self-signed
certificate (for instance, for accessing the server from a web app on
an https server), we recommend using the
[selfsigned](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selfsigned) package.

### Client (Connector)

The client class provided with this library implements the
IButtplugConnector interface, and needs to be passed to a
ButtplugClient class during connection.

```javascript
let Buttplug = require('buttplug');
let ButtplugNodeWebsockets = require('buttplug-node-websockets');

// The connector takes the websocket URL to connect to, and a boolean
// to know whether to reject on cert fail if connecting via secure
// websockets.
//
// If you are connecting to a local server, there is a good chance 
// it will be using a self-signed cert. You will need to pass 'false'
// as the second argument so the cert if not rejected. If you will 
// only be connecting to servers with actual CA verifiable certs,
// pass 'true'.
let connector = 
  new ButtplugNodeWebsocket.ButtplugNodeWebsocketClientConnector("wss://localhost:12345/buttplug", false);

let bpc = new bp.ButtplugClient("test");
bpc.Connect(c);
// ...
```
